= Spring Boot Backend Sample

== Requirements

MySQL:::
Create two databases, *development* and *test*.
The database must be running on `localhost:3306`.
The database username is `root` the password is `''` (empty) by default.

IMPORTANT: If possible https://www.eversql.com/mysql-utf8-vs-utf8mb4-whats-the-difference-between-utf8-and-utf8mb4/[use `utf8mb4`instead of `utf8` all the way].
However *this project will only work with `utf8`* for now.

IMPORTANT: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-session/issues/637[Because of this problem] however the database server must be configured to https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/xtradbinnodb-server-system-variables/#innodb_large_prefix[use large prefixes for InnoDB].

IMPORTANT: In recent MySQL and MariaDB versions this is enabled by default.
In older versions https://stackoverflow.com/a/43403017/433835[dynamic row format must be configured explicitly].

Flyway:::
Create or edit your Maven `settings.xml` (at `$HOME/.m2/settings.xml` or `%USERPROFILE%\.m2\settings.xml`) according to the `link:settings.sample.xml[]` in the root of this repository.

== Profiles

The roject relies on Maven profiles for development and Spring profiles for execution.

=== Maven

There are two profiles: *development* and *test*.

IMPORTANT: Define profiles *_only_* in `~/.m2/settings.xml`.

When running `flyway:clean` or similar select the right profile so that the plugin could select the right database.

`./mvnw flyway:clean -Pdevelopment` or `./mvnw flyway:clean -Ptest`

=== Spring

There are two Spring profiles: *development* and *local*.

During development, when starting the `Application` class (from your IDE) specify `-Dspring.profiles.active=development,local` to enable the profiles.

When starting the app through Maven either use the `-Dspring-boot.run.profiles=development,local` flag or use the *development* Maven flag because it sets this property by default (this will activate _both_ Spring profiles, not just the developement).

To start the app in development mode

`./mvnw spring-boot:run -Pdevelopment`

To run the tests

`./mvnw test -Ptest`

The *local* profile should be used to configure specific things related to a particular development machine.
For example if you use a different database port or username/password combination set these in the `application-local.properties`.

Properties in the local profile will take precedence over the development profile. This enables you to override default properties when needed.

IMPORTANT: *This file shouldn't be checked into version control.*
Also, make sure to rename `link:src/main/resources/application-local.sample.properties[application-local.sample.properties]` to `application-local.properties`, otherwise it won't be picked up by Spring.
